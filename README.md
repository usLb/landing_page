# landing_page

Its super exciting and scary at the same time to be very honest. Staring at a blank page and thinking about buuilding a page for the very first time. I will be using flexbox to style my css. 

Like I was instructed, i will first build my html before going to the css. So, for the first part, i will working on the header.
 
 <!-- task 1 Header
  - the header has one header logo on the left with and three links on the right
   so i'll be needing a .png file for my logo -->

Second part is the body and I believe there are four parts

<!--Task 2.1 Body
- first part consist of 
    two paragraph <p>*2 
    one button
    image

Task 2.2 
- second part consist of 
   one sub heading/paragraph
   four images with text underneath team

Task 2.3
- third part(not sure its the same line ...need to google how to add quotes in html)
   one long paragraph/quotes
   another paragraph 
Task 2.4
- fourth consit of 
   two paragraph
   one button  
   all under a padding / border / margin  
-->

Last is the footer and its a paragraph. That sum's up the whole of html now for the css part

(somehow i feel like the answer is in the flex exercises I did earlier)

The html part is done and now for the styling in .css
