# landing_page

Its super exciting and scary at the same time to be very honest. Staring at a blank page and thinking about buuilding a page for the very first time. I will be using flexbox to style my css. 

Like I was instructed, i will first build my html before going to the css. So, for the first part, i will working on the header.
 
 <!-- task 1 Header
  - the header has one header logo on the left with and three links on the right
   so i'll be needing a .png file for my logo -->

Second part is the body and I believe there are four parts

<!--Task 2.1 Body
- first part consist of 
    two paragraph <p>*2 
    one button
    image

Task 2.2 
- second part consist of 
   one sub heading/paragraph
   four images with text underneath team

Task 2.3
- third part(not sure its the same line ...need to google how to add quotes in html)
   one long paragraph/quotes
   another paragraph 
Task 2.4
- fourth consit of 
   two paragraph
   one button  
   all under a padding / border / margin  
-->

Last is the footer and its a paragraph. That sum's up the whole of html now for the css part

(somehow i feel like the answer is in the flex exercises I did earlier)

The html part is done and now for the styling in .css 
<!--So far, fonts and backgrouund color are given so all i need to do is move the flex containers and flex items untill I get the desiream outcome -->

<!--For the first part I'll take the body as a whole and apply flex then direction as column , I'll start from there and make micro changes part by part and google things and also look back to all the flex problem set as a referesher >

1. Apply display:flex and flex-direction:column on body.
2.fix the header and footer on there respective place 
   -style the links 
   -display flex 
   -text align-center 
3.subject1 need to make same them stay on the same line 
group the text and apply flex to stay on the same line
4.subject2 same like subject1
5.subject3 is wrapping the text under the image and putting them on flex-row
6.this is a quote ill add fonts and also chaneg  the text position (not as easy as it sounds)
7.last subject I need to add a padding margin or border not sure will dfigure it ouut somehow
